# 🇨🇦 Sub-250g Indoor Drone Use in Private or Rented Facilities (Canada)

This document summarizes the legal and practical considerations for operating **sub-250g drones indoors** in Canada, specifically within **rented buildings** or on **private property with permission**, as of 2025.

## ✅ 1. No Certification or Registration Required

Under **Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) Part IX**, drones **under 250 grams** are **exempt** from registration and licensing requirements.

More importantly:
> **Indoor flight is not regulated by Transport Canada**, as it does **not constitute navigable airspace**.

Therefore:
- **No registration**
- **No drone pilot certificate**
- **No RPAS rules** apply when operating indoors
