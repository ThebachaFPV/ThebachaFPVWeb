# 🇨🇦 Outdoor Drone Use on Private Property (250g – 1kg)

This document summarizes the Canadian regulations for operating **drones between 250 grams and 1 kilogram** outdoors on **private property**, as of 2025. These operations are regulated under **Transport Canada’s RPAS rules** (CARs Part IX).

---

## ✅ 1. Certification & Registration Required

Drones weighing between 250g and 25kg (including 250–1000g) are considered **Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS)** under Canadian Aviation Regulations.

### You MUST:
- **Register the drone** with Transport Canada  
- **Label the drone** with its registration number  
- **Hold a Basic or Advanced Pilot Certificate**, depending on how and where you fly

## 🛫 2. What Is Allowed on Private Property?

Operating on your own land or with **permission from the landowner** still requires compliance with airspace and RPAS rules:

### You **may fly** if:
- You are **outside controlled airspace**  
- You maintain **Visual Line of Sight (VLOS)**  
- You fly **below 400 feet AGL**  
- You **do not fly over people** (unless you have Advanced certification and a compliant drone)

## ⚠️ 3. Airspace Restrictions Still Apply

Even on private property, **Transport Canada regulates the airspace above it**.  
You must avoid:
- **Controlled or restricted airspace**
- **Near airports or heliports**
- **Within aerodrome traffic zones** without permission
