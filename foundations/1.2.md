# 1. Introduction

## 1.2. What is FPV Racing?

### Definition and Basics

First Person View (FPV) drone racing is a fast-growing sport where pilots fly small, high-speed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) through challenging courses while wearing goggles that display a live video feed from a camera mounted on their drone. This creates an immersive experience as if the pilot were sitting in the cockpit of the aircraft, hence the name "First Person View."

Unlike traditional remote-controlled aircraft piloting where the operator watches the vehicle from the ground, FPV racing provides a unique perspective that allows for precise control, lightning-fast reflexes, and a thrilling sense of flight that many describe as the closest thing to actually flying.

### Key Components of FPV Racing

#### The Aircraft

The Thebacha FPV Racing League focuses specifically on two classes of racing drones:

**Mini Whoop Class (Indoor Racing)**

- Small 65mm-75mm quadcopters with ducted propellers  
- Lightweight (typically 20-35 grams all-up weight)  
- Designed specifically for safe indoor flying  
- Feature smaller motors, integrated electronics, and protective ducts  
- Fly at speeds of 20-60 km/h  
- Perfect for beginners and indoor winter racing in northern climates  

**Sub-250 Class (Outdoor Racing)**

- Larger drones that weigh less than 250 grams all-up weight  
- Comply with simplified Canadian drone regulations for micro drones  
- Typically feature 2.5-4 inch propellers  
- Reach speeds of 60-120 km/h  
- More powerful than Mini Whoops but still within regulatory limits  
- Suitable for outdoor racing during favorable weather conditions  

Both classes typically:

- Feature flight controllers, electronic speed controllers (ESCs), and HD or analog cameras  
- Are built to be agile, durable, and easily repairable  
- Carry minimal additional weight beyond essential components  
- Can be purchased as ready-to-fly models or custom-built by pilots to suit their flying style  

#### Video Transmission System

The core of the FPV experience includes:

- A small camera mounted on the drone  
- A video transmitter (VTX) that broadcasts the camera feed  
- A receiver in the pilot's goggles that captures this signal  
- A display system inside the goggles showing the real-time video  
- Different frequency bands (typically 5.8 GHz) with multiple channels to prevent interference  

#### Control System

Pilots control their drones using:

- A radio transmitter (controller) held in their hands  
- A receiver on the drone that accepts commands  
- A digital link operating typically on 2.4 GHz or 900 MHz frequencies  
- Flight software that translates pilot inputs into motor commands  

### The Racing Experience

#### Courses

FPV races take place on courses that feature:

- Gates, flags, and obstacles that pilots must navigate through or around  
- Various terrain including indoor arenas, outdoor fields, forests, or abandoned structures  
- Course layouts ranging from technical precision courses to high-speed tracks  
- Natural and artificial obstacles that challenge different aspects of flying skill  

#### Race Formats

Common race formats include:

- **Time trials**: Each pilot flies the course individually, aiming for the fastest lap time  
- **Head-to-head races**: Multiple pilots (typically 4-6) race simultaneously  
- **Team races**: Pilots compete in teams, with combined scores determining the winners  
- **Freestyle competitions**: Judged events focused on creative flying and tricks rather than speed  

#### The Community

The FPV racing community is characterized by:

- A strong DIY (do-it-yourself) ethic where knowledge sharing is valued  
- Technical expertise spanning electronics, aerodynamics, and digital communications  
- A mix of competitive spirit and collaborative problem-solving  
- Pilots of varying ages and backgrounds united by their passion for flight  
- Local clubs and organizations that organize practice sessions and competitions  

### Adapting to Northern Conditions

FPV racing in Thebacha and the Northwest Territories presents unique considerations:

- Adjusting to extreme temperature variations that affect battery performance and electronics  
- Using Mini Whoops for indoor winter racing to maintain year-round flying opportunities  
- Leveraging Sub-250 class drones during warmer months for outdoor competitions  
- Embracing the unique landscape and natural features of the North for distinctive course designs  
- Addressing the challenges of limited access to parts and repair services in remote communities  
- Complying with simplified Canadian drone regulations by maintaining all outdoor racing drones under 250 grams  
- Developing indoor racing venues and courses that can be utilized during the long winter season  

Through the Thebacha FPV Racing League, we aim to adapt this global sport to our northern context, creating an experience that is both true to the essence of FPV racing and reflective of our unique community and environment.
