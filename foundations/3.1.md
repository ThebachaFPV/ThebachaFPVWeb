  - Small 1S batteries (≤550mAh) used for Mini Whoops may be charged without LiPo bags  
  - All batteries larger than 550mAh or higher than 1S configuration must be charged in LiPo safe bags  
- **Venue-Specific Requirements**:  
  - No charging of large LiPo batteries (>550mAh or >1S) permitted at indoor Mini Whoop racing venues  
  - If charging of larger batteries is absolutely necessary at a venue, it must be done in a designated area with a fire extinguisher immediately available  
- **Charging Equipment**: Use only proper LiPo balance chargers appropriate for the battery type  
- **Damage Inspection**: Regularly inspect batteries for damage, swelling, or punctures  
- **End-of-Life Disposal**: Properly discharge and dispose of damaged or end-of-life batteries  
- **Transportation**: Safe transport methods, including discharge to storage voltage and insulated terminals

- **Failsafe Requirements**: Specific failsafe configurations required for this class  
- **Signal Loss Protocols**: Procedures for handling signal loss or interference  
- **Wind Condition Limits**: Maximum wind speeds for safe operation  

### Pilot Physical Wellbeing

#### Fatigue Management

- **Flying Limits**: Recommended maximum continuous flying time  
- **Rest Periods**: Scheduled breaks during extended sessions  
- **Hydration**: Importance of maintaining proper hydration, especially in dry indoor environments  
- **Eye Strain**: Techniques to reduce FPV goggle-related eye fatigue  
- **Cognitive Awareness**: Recognizing when fatigue may impair safe operation  

#### Environmental Protection

- **Sun Protection**: Guidelines for outdoor events during summer months  
- **Insect Precautions**: Awareness of seasonal insect concerns  
- **Cold Protection**: Preventing cold-related injuries during winter operations  
- **Heat Management**: Preventing overheating in confined indoor spaces during winter  
- **Air Quality**: Protocols for when wildfire smoke or other air quality issues arise  

### Training and Qualification

#### Pilot Skill Assessment

- **New Pilot Orientation**: Safety briefing required for all new members  
- **Skill Level Identification**: System to identify pilot experience levels  
- **Supervised Practice**: Requirements for novice pilots to have supervision  
- **Progressive Access**: Graduated access to more challenging courses based on demonstrated skills  
- **Mentorship Program**: Pairing new pilots with experienced members for safety guidance  

#### Safety Training

- **Mandatory Briefings**: Regular safety information sessions required for all members  
- **Emergency Response**: Basic training on handling common emergency situations  
- **Fire Safety**: Specific training on LiPo fire risks and response  
- **First Aid Awareness**: Basic information on handling minor injuries  
- **Venue-Specific Training**: Safety information particular to each flying location  

### Incident Management

#### Response Procedures

- **Incident Definition**: Clear categorization of what constitutes a safety incident  
- **Immediate Response**: Step-by-step procedures for responding to various incidents  
- **Notification Chain**: Who to notify in case of various types of incidents  
- **Medical Emergency Process**: Procedures for handling injuries requiring medical attention  
- **Equipment Failure Response**: Protocols for handling equipment malfunctions safely
