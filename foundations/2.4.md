# 2. League Structure and Governance

## 2.4. Bylaws and Rules Committee

The development, maintenance, and interpretation of the league's governing documents and rules are essential for fair competition and effective organization. This section outlines how bylaws and rules will be developed and managed across both phases of the league's evolution.

### Phase 1: Initial Rules Development

During the informal first year of operations, the development and management of rules will follow a streamlined approach.

#### Structure and Responsibility

- **Founding Executives**: The President and Vice President will directly handle all rules development  
- **No Formal Committee**: A formal committee structure will not exist during Phase 1  
- **Ad Hoc Consultation**: Input will be gathered from active pilots as needed  
- **Documentation Focus**: Despite the informal structure, all rules will be clearly documented  

#### Rules Development Process

1. **Initial Framework**: Founding executives will establish a basic set of rules covering:  
   - Safety requirements  
   - Drone specifications for each class  
   - Race formats and procedures  
   - Pilot conduct expectations  
   - Scoring systems  
   - Venue-specific rules and protocols for each partner location  
   - League-specific operational guidelines for using partner venues  
   - Integration of partner venue requirements with league operations  

2. **Testing Period**: Initial rules will be implemented with a clear understanding that they are provisional  

3. **Feedback Collection**: Systematic collection of feedback from participants after each event  

4. **Iterative Improvement**: Regular revisions based on practical experience and participant input  

5. **Documentation**: Maintaining a single authoritative document with version control  

#### Rules Interpretation

- **Race Day Decisions**: The Racemaster (typically President or VP) will make final interpretations during events  
- **Post-Event Review**: Controversial interpretations will be reviewed between events  
- **Clarification Publishing**: Rule clarifications will be documented and shared with all participants  

#### Preparation for Phase 2

- **Initial Bylaw Development**: Some research and preliminary drafting of formal society bylaws will occur during Phase 1  
- **Learning from Experience**: Race rules will be refined based on the first yearâ€™s operations  
- **Documentation**: Creation of comprehensive documentation to support the transition to Phase 2  
- **Knowledge Transfer**: All draft bylaws and established rules created during Phase 1 will be formally provided to the Phase 2 committee  
- **Continuity Planning**: Ensuring that progress and insights gained during Phase 1 are preserved and built upon in Phase 2  

### Phase 2: Formal Bylaws and Rules Committee

With the establishment of the formal society, a dedicated committee structure will be implemented.

#### Committee Structure

- **Chair**: Appointed by the Board of Directors, typically a Board member  
- **Membership**: 3-5 members representing diverse perspectives:  
  - At least one executive officer  
  - At least one experienced pilot  
  - At least one technically knowledgeable member  
  - Potentially one community representative  
- **Term**: Committee members serve one-year renewable terms  
- **Meeting Frequency**: Quarterly at minimum, with additional meetings as needed  

#### Committee Responsibilities

1. **Bylaws Maintenance**:  
   - Interpreting society bylaws when questions arise  
   - Recommending bylaw amendments when necessary  
   - Ensuring compliance with NWT Societies Act requirements  
   - Developing supporting policies that align with bylaws  

2. **Competition Rules Development**:  
   - Maintaining the comprehensive rule book for all race classes  
   - Researching best practices from other racing leagues  
   - Evaluating and incorporating rule change proposals  
   - Ensuring rules reflect both fairness and the northern context  

3. **Technical Standards**:  
   - Defining specifications for each drone class  
   - Establishing inspection and compliance procedures  
   - Monitoring technological developments in FPV racing  
   - Adapting standards for northern environmental conditions  

4. **Venue Relationship Management**:  
   - Maintaining documentation of venue-specific requirements  
   - Developing protocols that integrate venue rules with league operations  
   - Creating venue-specific safety and operational checklists  
   - Regularly reviewing and updating venue agreements and procedures  

5. **Consultation and Communication**:  
   - Conducting member consultations on proposed changes  
   - Clearly communicating rule updates and interpretations  
   - Educating new members on rules and procedures  
   - Documenting rule interpretations and precedents  

### Rules Amendment Process

1. **Proposal Submission**: Members may submit rule change proposals in writing  
2. **Committee Review**: The Bylaws and Rules Committee evaluates all proposals  
3. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluation of the potential effects on competition and safety  
4. **Member Consultation**: Seeking input on significant changes  
5. **Recommendation Development**: Committee prepares formal recommendations  
6. **Board Approval**: Board of Directors votes on recommended changes  
7. **Implementation Planning**: Development of transition plans for approved changes  
8. **Communication**: Clear notification to all members of upcoming changes  

### Bylaw Amendment Process

1. **Identification**: Recognition of needed bylaw adjustments  
2. **Research**: Investigation of legal requirements and best practices  
3. **Drafting**: Development of proposed amendment language  
4. **Legal Review**: When appropriate, review by legal counsel  
5. **Board Approval**: Initial approval by the Board of Directors  
6. **Member Notification**: Advance notice to membership per bylaw requirements  
7. **Member Vote**: Formal vote at General Meeting as required by NWT Societies Act  
8. **Filing**: Submission of approved amendments to NWT Corporate Registry  

### Special Considerations for Northern Context

The approach to bylaws and rules accounts for several factors specific to our northern context:

- **Simplified Structures**: Less bureaucratic processes appropriate for a small community  
- **Local Adaptations**: Rules that reflect the realities of northern flying conditions  
- **Practical Enforcement**: Compliance approaches that work with limited resources  
- **Flexible Documentation**: Clear rules that can be applied consistently despite personnel changes  
- **Community Standards**: Alignment with local community values and expectations  

### Documentation Standards

All bylaws and rules will be maintained according to these standards:

- **Version Control**: Clear tracking of all versions with dates and change summaries  
- **Accessibility**: Available in both digital and print formats  
- **Plain Language**: Written in clear, straightforward language  
- **Consistent Formatting**: Uniform structure and numbering system  
- **Searchable**: Digital versions will be searchable for easy reference  
- **Practical Examples**: Where helpful, includes examples for clarity  
- **Regular Review**: Scheduled reviews to ensure continued relevance  

This approach to bylaws and rules development provides the necessary structure for fair competition and effective governance while maintaining the flexibility required for a developing organization in a northern community.
