Project: Young Pilot Kickstart.

Project Plan objective:

Kickstart youth through STEM based FPV Drone racing using local youth facilities and local drone league.
Mentor youth through orientation, simulator training, basic ground school and league rules and regulations.
They will learn not only to fly race style and freestyle acrobatics but how to build, solder, program and maintain these drones. Some youth may show aptitude for special technical roles and advance thier learning into specific areas of video transimission technologies and video editing and realtime streaming and producing, IT computing and programmings as well as construction and other skills.
Mentored skills gained though this project would translate directly into a modern workforce, trades, arts or military or even some areas of academia skills.  
Mentoring would use our current senior FPV pilots who already use these skills on a daily basis.
We will setup a non profit society for the club and when the project is over, there will  be an established organization, providing youth recreation and learning working with local facilities with long term youth goals.
This starts a solid and proven youth rec and learning experinece indoors during the winter munths and can translate to outdooors too after about a year.
Lots of kids have drones but nowhere to fly them, and with new drone laws kids need to lear how to operate drones responsibly and outside of these efforts thats not happening here.
The lasting benefits of this project is a local society run by volunteers that foster the relationship between the experienced pilots, young pilots and local facilities through STEM mentoring and hands on real world experience. At longer scales, this will be a template for outer communities to use to do the same for thier youth.
resulting in a territorial group of leges that can collaorate at the territortial level.
Youth going through this process will come away with a better undetanding of a variaety of STEM elements even if they do not turn out be great pilots.
