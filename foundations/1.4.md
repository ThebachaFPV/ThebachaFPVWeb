## 1.4 About This Document

### Purpose and Scope

The "Foundations: Establishing the Thebacha FPV Racing League" document serves as the comprehensive framework and roadmap for creating, operating, and growing our local drone racing community. This document is intended to be both foundational and evolvingâ€”establishing core principles while allowing for adaptation as the league develops.

### Intended Audiences

This document has been created with several key audiences in mind:

- **Founding Members**: To provide clear guidance on establishing governance, operations, and standards  
- **Future Participants**: To offer transparent information about how the league functions and how to get involved  
- **Community Partners**: To communicate the league's structure, safety protocols, and community benefits  
- **Venue Operators**: To clearly outline our operational requirements and safety measures  
- **Local Authorities**: To demonstrate our commitment to regulatory compliance and safety  
- **Other NWT Communities**: To offer a template that can be adapted for establishing similar leagues  

### How to Use This Document

The Foundations document is structured to be both comprehensive and practical:

- **Modular Sections**: Each section addresses a specific aspect of the league's establishment and operation  
- **Sequential Development**: The document follows a logical progression from concept to implementation  
- **Practical Tools**: Throughout the document, you'll find templates, checklists, and resources that can be directly applied  
- **Living Content**: As indicated in our revision history (Appendix 16.5), this document will be updated as we learn and grow  

### Document Status and Review

This document represents the collective work and consensus of the founding members of the Thebacha FPV Racing League. It was initially developed in March 2025 and will undergo regular review according to our two-phase establishment plan:

#### Phase 1: Informal League (First Year)

- **Initial Governance**: Executive positions will be filled by self-appointed founding members  
- **Quarterly Review**: The document will be formally reviewed every three months  
- **Foundational Development**: Procedures, formats, and standards will be tested and refined  
- **Society Preparation**: Groundwork will be laid for formal society establishment  

#### Phase 2: Formal Society Establishment (Second Year)

- **Legal Formation**: The Thebacha FPV Racing League Society will be formally established  
- **Elected Leadership**: Executive and board positions will be filled through proper elections  
- **Continued Quarterly Review**: Document review will continue on a quarterly basis throughout the first year of society operation  
- **Transition to Annual Review**: After the second year (first year as a society), the document will transition to annual reviews with amendments as needed  

Throughout both phases:

- **Member Input**: All league members are encouraged to suggest improvements or clarifications  
- **Approval Process**: Changes to fundamental principles require approval as outlined in section 2.3 (Decision-Making Process)  

### Key Principles of This Document

- **Clarity**: Information is presented in straightforward, accessible language

- **Northern Context**: Content is specifically adapted to the realities of our northern community
