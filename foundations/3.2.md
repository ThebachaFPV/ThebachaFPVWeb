# 3. Safety Standards and Protocols

## 3.2. Spectator Safety

The Thebacha FPV Racing League is committed to creating a safe environment for spectators to enjoy and learn about drone racing. This section outlines the protocols and measures that will be implemented to ensure spectator safety at all league events.

### Physical Safety Measures

#### Spectator Areas and Barriers

- **Established Venue Protocols**: Adherence to existing safety protocols at our current indoor venues:  
  - **Fort Smith Rec Center Gym**: All spectators must remain behind the glass wall at all times. Only league members, rec staff, and approved guests are permitted in the gym during league activities.  
  - **Uncle Gabes Friendship Center Gym**: Spectators must use the safe viewing room located above the gym. Only league members, Uncle Gabes staff, and approved guests are allowed in the gym during league activities.

- **Physical Barriers**: Utilization of existing structural barriers at established venues and appropriate barriers at any new locations  
  - **Indoor Events**: Natural separation (glass walls, viewing rooms) at established venues; netting or other barriers at new locations  
  - **Outdoor Events**: Distance buffers, caution tape, or physical barriers as appropriate  

#### Environmental Considerations

- **Indoor Venue Safety**:  
  - Clear marking of emergency exits  
  - Ensuring spectator areas do not block fire exits or safety equipment  
  - Appropriate capacity limits based on venue size  
  - Adequate ventilation, particularly in areas where batteries are being charged  

- **Outdoor Venue Safety**:  
  - Weather monitoring and event modification procedures  
  - Protection from elements (sun, wind, insects) where possible  
  - Clear boundaries for event perimeter  
  - Vehicle separation from pedestrian areas
