# 3.6 Waivers and Liability Forms

Proper documentation and legal protection are essential components of the Thebacha FPV Racing League's risk management strategy. This section outlines the waiver and liability forms required for all league activities, their implementation, and specific considerations for our northern context.

## Required Waiver Documentation

### Participant Liability Waiver

All active participants in league activities must complete a comprehensive liability waiver that includes:

- **Acknowledgment of Risks**: Clear description of inherent risks in drone racing activities
- **Assumption of Risk**: Explicit acceptance of identified risks
- **Release of Liability**: Waiver of right to sue the league, its leadership, and venues for inherent risks
- **Media Release**: Permission to use images and video from events for league purposes
- **Code of Conduct**: Agreement to abide by league rules and safety protocols
- **Term of Validity**: Typically valid for one year from signing

### Guardian Consent Forms

For participants under 18 years of age:

- **Parental/Guardian Consent**: Signed permission from parent or legal guardian
- **Assumption of Risk on Behalf of Minor**: Parent/guardian acknowledgment of risks
- **Supervision Agreement**: Commitment to appropriate adult supervision
- **Emergency Contact Information**: Comprehensive contact details for responsible adults
- **Medical Information**: Relevant health information for emergency response

### Spectator Notification

While formal waivers from spectators may not be practical, the league will implement:

- **Clear Signage**: Posted notices at all venues regarding spectator assumption of risk
- **Event Programs/Handouts**: Written risk notices in any distributed materials
- **Verbal Announcements**: Safety and risk information at the beginning of public events
- **Designated Areas**: Clear marking of safe spectator zones

### Venue-Specific Agreements

Additional documentation required for specific venues:

- **Fort Smith Rec Center Gym**: Compliance with any facility-specific waiver requirements
- **Uncle Gabes Friendship Center Gym**: Adherence to any venue-specific liability documentation
- **Outdoor Locations**: Any permits or permission forms required for public lands

## Implementation Procedures

### Distribution and Collection

- **Membership Registration**: Waivers incorporated into initial membership process
- **Electronic Options**: Consideration of digital signing platforms where feasible
- **Paper Alternatives**: Printed forms available for those without digital access
- **Renewal Process**: System for annual waiver renewal
- **Verification System**: Method to confirm current waiver status before participation

### Record Keeping

- **Secure Storage**: Confidential maintenance of all signed forms
- **Digital Backup**: Scanned copies or electronic originals stored securely
- **Organized Filing**: System for quick verification of waiver status
- **Duration of Retention**: Retention of waiver documentation for a minimum of two years after expiration
- **Privacy Protection**: Safeguarding of personal information in accordance with privacy regulations

### Verification at Events

- **Check-in Procedure**: Verification of waiver status at event registration
- **On-site Signing**: Process for completing waivers at events if not previously signed
- **Minor Verification**: Additional checks for proper documentation of youth participants
- **Guest Procedures**: Process for one-time participants or visitors

## Waiver Content Development

### Legal Considerations

- **Plain Language**: Use of clear, understandable terms while maintaining legal efficacy
- **Completeness**: Covering all reasonably foreseeable risks and activities
- **Enforceability**: Designing waivers that meet legal standards for the Northwest Territories
- **Legal Review**: When possible, review by legal counsel familiar with recreational activity waivers
- **Regulatory Alignment**: Compliance with any applicable territorial regulations

### Activity-Specific Elements

- **Class-Specific Risks**: Different waiver sections for Mini Whoop versus Sub-250 activities
- **Indoor vs. Outdoor**: Acknowledgment of different risk profiles for different environments
- **Spectator Interaction**: Coverage of risks related to public demonstration or viewing
- **Equipment Handling**: Specific mention of battery handling and other equipment risks
- **Northern Environment**: Recognition of risks specific to northern climate and conditions

### Clarity and Comprehension

- **Readability Assessment**: Ensuring waivers are understandable to the average participant
- **Multi-Format Availability**: Providing waivers in multiple formats for accessibility
- **Verbal Explanation**: Process for explaining waiver content to those who request it
- **Questions Opportunity**: Clear avenue for addressing questions about waiver content
- **Language Considerations**: Accommodation for participants whose first language is not English

## Special Considerations for Northern Context

### Remote Location Factors

- **Emergency Services Acknowledgment**: Recognition of potentially extended emergency response times
- **Transportation Challenges**: Acknowledgment of risks related to remote flying locations
- **Communication Limitations**: Recognition of possible communication challenges in remote areas
- **Self-Sufficiency Requirements**: Participant acknowledgment of responsibility for appropriate preparation

### Weather and Environmental Factors

- **Extreme Cold Recognition**: Specific mention of risks associated with winter activities
- **Seasonal Hazards**: Acknowledgment of seasonal environmental risks (ice, wildlife, etc.)
- **Daylight Variations**: Recognition of risks associated with limited daylight periods
- **Rapid Weather Changes**: Acknowledgment of northern weather variability

## Phase-Specific Implementation

### Phase 1 (First Year)

- **Basic Templates**: Development of fundamental waiver documents
- **Manual Processes**: Initially paper-based systems for collection and verification
- **Simplicity Focus**: Straightforward implementation while maintaining legal protection
- **Resource Development**: Creation of signage and notification materials

### Phase 2 (Second Year)

- **Enhanced Documentation**: More comprehensive waivers aligned with society status
- **Electronic Systems**: Potential implementation of digital signing and verification
- **Integration**: Coordination with membership management systems
- **Expanded Coverage**: Additional waiver elements based on Phase 1 experiences

## Sample Templates and Resources

The following templates will be developed and included in Appendix 16.1:

- **Adult Participant Waiver**: Comprehensive release for participants 18 and older
- **Minor Participant Waiver**: Parental/guardian consent form for youth participants
- **Event Signage Templates**: Standard warning and notification signage
- **Venue Agreement Templates**: Documentation for relationships with facilities
- **Waiver Registry**: Format for tracking waiver status of all participants
- **Special Event Forms**: Additional documentation for public demonstrations or competitions

This comprehensive approach to waivers and liability forms establishes clear legal protection for the league while ensuring transparency for participants regarding the risks they are assuming.
