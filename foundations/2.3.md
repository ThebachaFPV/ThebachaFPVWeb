# 2. League Structure and Governance

## 2.3. Decision-Making Process

Effective governance of the Thebacha FPV Racing League requires clear processes for making decisions that affect league operations, policies, and events. This section outlines how decisions will be made during both phases of the league's development, ensuring transparency, appropriate input, and efficient resolution.

### Core Decision-Making Principles

The following principles guide all league decision-making processes:

1. **Transparency**: Decision-making procedures are clear and visible to members  
2. **Appropriate Consultation**: Those affected by decisions have opportunities for input  
3. **Timely Resolution**: Processes balance thoroughness with the need for efficient decisions  
4. **Respect for Expertise**: Technical decisions are informed by relevant expertise  
5. **Documentation**: Significant decisions are recorded for future reference  
6. **Accessibility**: Decision-making processes are accessible to all members  
7. **Northern Context**: Processes account for the unique challenges of our northern community  

### Phase 1: Informal League Decision-Making

During the first year, as an informal organization, the league will operate with a streamlined decision-making process reflecting the reality that typically only two founding members will be handling all executive functions.

#### Executive Decisions

- **Simple Consensus**: Decisions will be made by consensus between the founding members serving as executives  
- **President's Authority**: In situations requiring immediate action, the President may make decisions independently, then inform the Vice President  
- **Regular Check-ins**: The founding executives will maintain frequent, informal communication rather than formal scheduled meetings  
- **Documentation**: Despite the informal structure, key decisions will still be documented for future reference  
- **Practicality**: The decision-making process prioritizes practicality and quick implementation during this foundational phase  
- **Communication**: Significant decisions will be communicated to participating members and pilots  

#### Member Input

- **Regular Member Meetings**: All-member meetings held quarterly  
- **Proposal Process**: Members may submit written proposals for consideration  
- **Advisory Votes**: On significant matters, members may participate in advisory votes  
- **Feedback Channels**: Clear methods for members to provide input between meetings  
- **Development Sessions**: Special sessions for collaborative input on major league developments  

#### Race-Day Decisions

- **Racemaster Authority**: Final decision-making authority for all race-day operations and safety matters  
- **Technical Decisions**: Race Technicians have authority for equipment compliance decisions  
- **Appeals Process**: Pilots may appeal decisions following the event for future consideration  
- **Safety Priority**: Safety-related decisions cannot be overruled during an event  

#### Decision Categories and Authority (Phase 1)

| Decision Type         | Primary Decision Makers           | Input Considered From   | Communication Method         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Strategic Direction   | Founding Executives              | Active Participants     | Informal Gatherings          |
| Operational Policies  | Founding Executives              | Affected Participants   | Direct Communication         |
| Technical Standards   | Founding Executives              | Active Pilots           | Pre-Race Briefings           |
| Race Formats          | Founding Executives              | Active Pilots           | Announcement Prior to Events |
| Event Scheduling      | Founding Executives              | Available Pilots        | Social Media/Messaging       |
| Race-Day Operations   | Racemaster (Pres./VP)            | N/A                     | Pilot Briefings              |
| Disciplinary Actions  | Founding Executives              | Involved Parties        | Direct Communication         |
| Expenditures          | Founding Executives              | N/A                     | Tracked Informally           |

### Phase 2: Formal Society Decision-Making

With the establishment as a formal society, the decision-making process will evolve.

#### Board of Directors Decisions

- **Regular Meetings**: The Board meets monthly according to a published schedule  
- **Quorum Requirements**: As defined in society bylaws (typically a majority of directors)  
- **Formal Motions**: Decisions made through formal motions, seconds, and votes  
- **Majority Rule**: Simple majority for most decisions; special majorities for significant matters  
- **Documentation**: Formal minutes recording all motions, votes, and decisions  
- **Open Meetings**: Members may observe board meetings except during in-camera sessions  
- **Notice Requirements**: Advance notice of meeting agendas provided to all directors  

#### Executive Implementation

- **Operational Discretion**: Executive officers implement board decisions with operational discretion  
- **Delegated Authority**: Board may delegate specific decision-making authority to executive officers  
- **Reporting Requirements**: Regular reports to the board on implementation progress  
- **Emergency Actions**: Process for emergency decisions between board meetings  

#### Member Involvement

- **Annual General Meeting**: Formal voting on board elections and major league decisions  
- **Special Meetings**: Called for significant decisions requiring membership approval  
- **Committee Structure**: Standing committees providing specialized input to the board  
- **Consultation Requirements**: Formal requirements for member consultation on major changes  
- **Proposal Mechanism**: Structured process for members to put forward formal proposals  

#### Decision Hierarchies

1. **Membership Decisions**: Constitutional changes, board elections, major policy directions  
2. **Board Decisions**: Strategic planning, policy approval, significant expenditures, formal partnerships  
3. **Executive Decisions**: Implementation details, day-to-day operations, minor expenditures  
4. **Committee Decisions**: Recommendations to the board in areas of committee expertise  
5. **Operational Decisions**: Race management, event logistics, and immediate safety matters  

### Special Considerations for Northern Context

The decision-making process accounts for several factors unique to our northern community:

- **Flexible Participation**: Options for remote participation in decision-making when travel is difficult  
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: More intensive decision-making during racing season, reduced during off-season  
- **Resource Awareness**: All financial decisions consider the limited resources of a small community  
- **Community Alignment**: Major decisions consider alignment with broader community needs and priorities  
- **Documentation Emphasis**: Given potential leadership transitions, thorough documentation of rationales  

### Documentation of Decisions

All significant decisions will be documented to ensure continuity and transparency:

- **Meeting Minutes**: Formal record of all official meetings and decisions  
- **Decision Logs**: Tracking of major decisions with rationales and implementation notes  
- **Policy Documentation**: Compilation of all approved policies and procedures  
- **Communication Records**: Archive of how decisions were communicated to members  
- **Review Tracking**: Documentation of when and how decisions are reviewed and evaluated  

This decision-making framework provides clarity and structure while maintaining the flexibility needed for a developing organization in a northern community.
