  - Proper identification markings  

#### Video System Verification

- **Frequency Setting**: Confirmation of assigned frequency  
- **Power Output**: Verification of appropriate power setting for venue  
  - 25mW maximum for indoor Mini Whoop events  
  - 200mW maximum for outdoor Sub-250 events  
- **Channel Isolation**: Testing for minimal interference with adjacent channels  
- **Antenna Condition**: Verification of secure mounting and good condition  
- **OSD Configuration**: Verification of pilot identification in video feed when available  

#### Flight Control Verification

- **Arm/Disarm Function**: Testing of proper arming and disarming
