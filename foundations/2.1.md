# 2. League Structure and Governance

## 2.1. Organizational Structure

The Thebacha FPV Racing League will evolve through two distinct phases as it grows from an informal community group to a formally established society. This section outlines the organizational structure during each phase and defines key roles and reporting relationships.

### Phase 1: Informal League Structure (First Year)

During the initial establishment phase, the league will operate with a streamlined organizational structure focused on building foundations and community.

#### Executive Committee

- **President**: Primary leadership role responsible for overall vision, community relationships, and public representation  
- **Vice President**: Supports the president, leads specific initiatives, and acts as primary backup for presidential duties  
- **Secretary/Treasurer**: Manages documentation, finances, and record-keeping (this role may initially be shared between President and Vice President until membership growth supports dedicated positions)  

#### Race Team

- **Racemaster**: Appointed for each event to oversee race operations, enforce rules, maintain safety standards, and control the flow of races  
- **Co-Racemaster** (Optional): Assists the Racemaster during larger events or more complex race formats  
- **Race Technician(s)**: Responsible for technical compliance checking, weight verification, pit management, and frequency assignment  

#### Membership

- **Active Members**: Individuals who have officially joined the league, participate in events, and provide input on league development  
- **Founding Members**: Initial participants who help establish league foundations and may serve in multiple support roles  

#### Reporting Structure

- The Executive Committee maintains overall responsibility for league operations and development  
- The Race Team reports to the Executive Committee but has delegated authority during race events  
- Members provide input directly to the Executive Committee during regular meetings and through informal channels  

### Phase 2: Formal Society Structure (Second Year Onward)

Upon formal establishment as the Thebacha FPV Racing League Society, the organization will transition to a more comprehensive structure.

#### Executive Officers

- **President**: Elected leader responsible for overall direction, external relationships, and society representation  
- **Vice President**: Elected position supporting the president and overseeing specific operational areas  
- **Secretary**: Elected position responsible for documentation, record-keeping, and communications  
- **Treasurer**: Elected position managing financial matters, budgeting, and financial reporting  

#### Board of Directors

- **Executive Officers**: The above positions serve on the Board  
- **Directors-at-Large**: Additional elected board members representing the membership  
- **Committee Chairs**: Leaders of standing committees may serve on or report to the Board  

#### Race Management Team

- **Racemaster**: Appointed or elected position responsible for race day operations, rules enforcement, and competition oversight  
- **Co-Racemaster**: Assists the Racemaster, particularly during larger events  
- **Chief Technical Officer**: Oversees technical compliance, safety inspections, and equipment standards  
- **Race Technicians**: Support the Chief Technical Officer in managing drone compliance, weight verification, and pit operations  

#### Standing Committees (as needed)

- **Safety Committee**: Develops and oversees safety protocols and incident response  
- **Technical Committee**: Evaluates equipment standards, classification systems, and technical regulations  
- **Events Committee**: Plans and coordinates racing events and social activities  
- **Marketing/Community Outreach Committee**: Manages external communications and community relationships  

#### Membership Categories

- **Regular Members**: Active participants with voting rights in society matters  
- **Junior Members**: Participants under 18 years of age with modified voting privileges  
- **Honorary Members**: Non-racing supporters or contributors to the league  

#### Reporting Structure

- The Board of Directors is accountable to the membership through regular meetings and annual elections  
- The Executive Officers report to the Board on operational matters  
- The Race Management Team reports to the Executive for event planning and to the Board for policy matters  
- Standing Committees report to the Board or designated Executive Officer  

### Decision-Making Authority

#### Phase 1 (Informal League)

- The Executive Committee makes operational decisions with input from members  
- The Racemaster has final authority on race day for safety and competition matters  
- Major decisions affecting league direction are made collaboratively with founding members  

#### Phase 2 (Formal Society)

- The Board of Directors holds decision-making authority for strategic and policy matters  
- The Executive implements Board decisions and manages day-to-day operations  
- The membership votes on constitutional matters, board elections, and major league changes  
- The Racemaster retains operational authority during race events  

### Special Considerations for Northern Context

The organizational structure accounts for several factors specific to our northern context:

- Smaller population base requiring flexible multi-role positions  
- Seasonal variations affecting meeting and event frequency  
- Geographic challenges for participant involvement  
- Potential for virtual participation in some administrative functions  

This organizational structure is designed to evolve as the league grows, with roles and responsibilities expanding to meet the changing needs of the Thebacha FPV Racing League and its community.
