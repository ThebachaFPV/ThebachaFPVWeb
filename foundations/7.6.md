## 7.6 Rule Changes and Updates

This section establishes the process for modifying, updating, and evolving the rules and regulations of the Thebacha FPV Racing League. A clear, transparent approach to rule changes ensures that the league can adapt to changing circumstances, technological developments, and community needs while maintaining fairness and consistency.

## Rule Change Philosophy

### Guiding Principles

- **Stability Priority**: Preference for consistent rules with minimal mid-season changes
- **Evidence-Based Changes**: Modifications based on observed needs rather than speculation
