# 4. Technical Standards

## 4.1 Aircraft Classifications

The Thebacha FPV Racing League has established clear aircraft classifications to ensure fair competition, appropriate safety measures, and compliance with Canadian drone regulations. This section defines the two primary drone classes used in league events and outlines the technical specifications and operational parameters for each.

### Primary Racing Classes

The league recognizes two primary racing classes, each with distinct specifications and intended use environments:

#### Mini Whoop Class

The Mini Whoop class is designed for indoor racing in confined spaces, prioritizing safety while maintaining competitive appeal.

##### Definition and Core Characteristics

- **Size Range**: 65mm-75mm motor-to-motor diagonal measurement  
- **Weight Limit**: Maximum all-up weight of 35 grams  
- **Propeller Protection**: Fully ducted propellers required (enclosed propeller guards)  
- **Flight Controller**: Any F4 or equivalent flight controller with appropriate firmware  
- **Motors**: Maximum size of 1103 for 65mm frames and 1105 for 75mm frames  
- **Battery**: 1S LiPo (3.7V nominal) with maximum capacity of 550mAh  
- **Video System**: Analog video using RaceBand frequencies with maximum 25mW transmission power at indoor venues  
- **Receiver**: Compatible with major RC protocols (FrSky, Spektrum, FlySky, etc.)  

##### Intended Use Environment

- Primary use in indoor venues (Fort Smith Rec Center Gym, Uncle Gabes Friendship Center Gym)  
- Suitable for year-round racing regardless of outdoor weather conditions  
- Appropriate for confined spaces with spectator separation  
- Ideal for new pilot training and skill development  
- Safe for proximity flying with appropriate precautions  

##### Subclassifications (Optional Future Development)

- **Micro Whoop**: Potential future category for smaller 65mm variants  
- **Stock Class**: Potential category with standardized components for all competitors  
- **Open Class**: Modified Mini Whoops with enhanced performance within size/weight limits  

#### Sub-250 Class

The Sub-250 class is designed for outdoor racing while maintaining compliance with simplified Canadian drone regulations for micro drones under 250 grams.

##### Definition and Core Characteristics

- **Weight Limit**: Maximum all-up weight of 249 grams (fully assembled with battery)  
- **Size Range**: Typically 2.5-4 inch propeller diameter (no strict size limit provided weight limit is maintained)  
- **Flight Controller**: Any flight controller compatible with racing firmware  
- **Propellers**: Maximum 5-inch diameter  
- **Battery**: Maximum 4S LiPo (16.8V nominal)  
- **Video System**: Analog or digital with maximum 200mW transmission power for outdoor use  
- **Receiver**: Compatible with major RC protocols  
- **Failsafe Configuration**: Required motor stop failsafe on signal loss  

##### Intended Use Environment

- Primary use in outdoor venues during favorable weather conditions  
- Appropriate for larger racing courses with extended flight range  
- Suitable for more experienced pilots  
- Compliance with Transport Canada regulations for micro drone operations  
- Appropriate separation from spectators per safety guidelines  

##### Subclassifications (Optional Future Development)

- **Cinematic Sub-250**: Configuration optimized for smooth video capture  
- **Sprint Sub-250**: Configuration optimized for short, technical courses  
- **Endurance Sub-250**: Configuration optimized for longer flight times  

### Classification Governance

#### Classification Determination

- **Official Weighing**: All drones must be weighed on calibrated league scales  
- **Complete Configuration**: Weight measurement includes all components in ready-to-fly state  
- **Documentation**: Classification verification recorded in league records  
- **Marking System**: Clear identification of verified class compliance  

#### Modification Restrictions

- **Weight Modifications**: No modifications permitted that exceed class weight limits  
- **Propulsion Limitations**: Motor and propeller sizes must remain within class specifications  
- **Video Power Restrictions**: No alteration of video transmitter power beyond specified limits  
- **Safety Features**: No removal or modification of required safety features  

#### Multi-Class Participation

- **Separate Registration**: Pilots may register different drones in multiple classes  
- **Equipment Separation**: Clear identification of which drone is used for which class  
- **Class Switching**: Procedures for switching between classes during events  
- **Qualification Requirements**: Skills demonstration may be required for Sub-250 class participation  

### Northern Adaptations

#### Cold Weather Considerations

- **Mini Whoop Advantages**: Recognition of indoor Mini Whoop racing as primary winter activity  
- **Battery Performance**: Acknowledgment of reduced performance in cold conditions for outdoor racing  
- **Material Limitations**: Awareness of increased brittleness of some plastics in extreme cold  
- **Season Planning**: Scheduling emphasis on indoor competition during winter months  

#### Indoor Venue Adaptations

- **Course Scale**: Course designs appropriate for venue size constraints  
- **Power Limitations**: Reduced video transmitter power for indoor interference management  
- **Specific Venue Requirements**: Custom rules for each indoor facility  
- **Seasonal Capacity**: Increased indoor racing during winter months  
- **Special Indoor Sub-250 Events**: Possibility of indoor events for Sub-250 class (and potentially heavier drones) under specific circumstances with additional safety protocols  
- **Edge Case Rules**: For any indoor events involving drones above Mini Whoop class, specific rules will be established on a per-event basis with enhanced safety measures, power limitations, and venue-specific protocols  

### Regulatory Alignment

#### Transport Canada Compliance

- **Sub-250 Advantage**: Leveraging simplified regulatory framework for drones under 250 grams  
- **Registration Requirements**: Clarity on current Transport Canada requirements  
- **Marking Compliance**: Appropriate aircraft marking per current regulations  
- **Operational Limitations**: Adherence to any altitude, distance, or airspace restrictions  

#### Future Regulatory Changes

- **Monitoring Process**: System for tracking regulatory updates  
- **Adaptation Plan**: Framework for adjusting classifications as needed  
- **Member Notification**: Process for communicating regulatory changes  
- **Compliance Transition**: Procedures for implementing necessary modifications  

### Classification Enforcement

#### Inspection Procedures

- **Initial Verification**: Process for initial classification certification  
- **Random Checks**: System for ongoing compliance verification  
- **Post-Modification Inspection**: Requirements after any significant changes  
- **Referee Authority**: Final determination of classification compliance during events  

#### Non-Compliance Consequences

- **Minor Infractions**: Warning and required correction process  
- **Weight Violations**: Disqualification from events in the affected class  
- **Safety Violations**: Removal from competition until resolved  
- **Repeated Issues**: Progressive disciplinary measures  

This classification system provides clear guidelines while maintaining flexibility for growth and adaptation as the Thebacha FPV Racing League evolves and the technology continues to develop.
