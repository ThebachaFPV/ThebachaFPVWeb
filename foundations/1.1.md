## 1.1. Purpose and Vision

#### Purpose

The Thebacha FPV Racing League is established to create a structured, safe, and inclusive community for First Person View (FPV) drone racing enthusiasts in Fort Smith and the surrounding Thebacha area. This league serves as the primary organizing body for competitive and recreational drone racing events, technical advancement, and community engagement within our local community.

Our purpose extends beyond simply hosting races; we aim to:

- Provide a regulated framework for fair and exciting FPV drone competition at the local level  
- Establish clear safety standards that protect participants, spectators, and our community  
- Create opportunities for skills development across all experience levels within Fort Smith  
- Promote responsible drone usage within local regulations and northern conditions  
- Serve as advocates for the drone racing community with local authorities and venues  
- Build connections between technology enthusiasts, STEM education, and the broader Thebacha community  
- Create a model that can be shared with and adapted by other communities across the Northwest Territories  

#### Vision

The Thebacha FPV Racing League envisions becoming a vibrant focal point for drone racing in Fort Smith, with the potential to inspire similar initiatives across the Northwest Territories:

##### Community Focus

We aspire to build an inclusive, diverse, and supportive community that welcomes participants of all backgrounds, ages, and skill levels from Fort Smith and nearby areas. The league will foster camaraderie, knowledge sharing, and mentorship, creating lasting connections among members in our northern community.

##### Technical Innovation

Our league will embrace and advance technological innovations in the FPV racing space, encouraging members to explore new designs, techniques, and adaptations particularly suited to northern conditions. We will serve as a testing ground for emerging technologies and racing formats that work in our unique environment.

##### Competitive Excellence

We strive to develop competitive race formats and environments that challenge local pilots, recognize achievement, and eventually create pathways to territorial competition with other Northwest Territories communities. The league will establish standards of organization, timing, and course design that can be shared across the territory.

##### Educational Impact

The Thebacha FPV Racing League aims to serve as an educational platform, introducing STEM concepts through the exciting medium of drone racing to our local youth. We will develop programs specifically designed to engage young people and newcomers to the sport in Fort Smith.

##### Sustainable Growth

Our vision includes sustainable, measured growth that balances expansion with quality experiences. We will develop infrastructure, venues, and partnerships that can support the long-term vitality of the sport in our community, while creating a framework that can potentially be adopted by other communities in the Northwest Territories.

##### Regional Collaboration

The league will work to establish connections with other communities across the Northwest Territories, sharing knowledge, resources, and best practices to encourage the growth of FPV racing throughout the territory. We envision future inter-community events and territorial competitions that bring together enthusiasts from across the North.

Through this purpose and vision, the Thebacha FPV Racing League will establish itself not only as a local sporting organization but as a pioneer in northern drone racing that can inspire and support similar initiatives across the Northwest Territories, ultimately creating a network of community-based leagues that enrich the technological, recreational, and social landscape of our territory.
