# 3. Safety Standards and Protocols

## 3.3. Equipment Safety Requirements

The Thebacha FPV Racing League establishes clear equipment safety standards to minimize risks associated with drone racing. This section outlines the mandatory safety features, inspection procedures, and class-specific requirements for all drones used in league events.

### General Safety Requirements for All Drones

#### Mandatory Safety Features

- **Propeller Protection**:  
  - **Mini Whoop Class**: Must have fully ducted propellers for complete blade protection  
  - **Sub-250 Class**: Propeller guards recommended but not required for outdoor events  

- **Failsafe Configuration**:  
  - **Sub-250 Class**: All outdoor drones must have properly configured failsafe systems that, at minimum, cut power to motors upon signal loss  
  - **Mini Whoop Class**: Failsafe configuration not required for indoor racing  
  - Failsafe testing and verification before every outdoor race day  

- **Arming Safety**:  
  - All drones must have an arming system that prevents accidental motor activation  
  - Motors must not spin upon simply connecting the battery  

- **Battery Mounting**:  
  - Batteries must be securely mounted to prevent ejection during flight or crash  
  - No loose mounting using only friction or tape  

- **Structural Integrity**:  
  - No exposed wiring or sharp edges that could cause injury  
  - All components must be securely mounted  
  - Frame must be intact without cracks that compromise structural integrity  

#### Electrical Safety

- **Power Systems**:  
  - No exposed connections that could cause shorts  
  - Properly sized wiring for current requirements  
  - Appropriate insulation on all electrical connections  

- **Battery Requirements**:  
  - Only lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries in good condition permitted  
  - No batteries with physical damage, puffing, or deformation  
  - Appropriate connectors for current requirements  
  - Conformity to capacity and cell count limits for competition class  

- **Charging Safety**:  
  - As outlined in Section 3.1, appropriate charging procedures must be followed  
  - For batteries >550mAh or >1S, charging must occur in LiPo safe bags  
  - No charging of large LiPo batteries (>550mAh or >1S) at Mini Whoop indoor venues unless a dedicated safe LiPo charging station has been set up with appropriate fire safety measures  

### Class-Specific Equipment Requirements

  - Maximum video transmitter power at indoor venues: 25mW  
  - Frequency coordination required  
  - No deliberately modified VTX units to exceed power limits  

#### Sub-250 Class (Outdoor Racing)

  - Maximum all-up weight: 249 grams (to comply with simplified Canadian drone regulations)  
  - No minimum or maximum frame size within weight limit  

- **Propulsion**:  
  - No damaged propellers permitted  
  - Maximum propeller size: 5 inch diameter  
  - Motors appropriate for frame size and weight  

- **Power System**:  
  - Maximum battery: 4S LiPo (16.8V nominal)  
  - Battery must be secured with an appropriate strap, not just friction  
  - Standard power connectors (XT30, XT60)  

- **Video System**:  
  - Maximum video transmitter power: 200mW  
  - Frequency coordination required  
  - Antennas must be properly secured  

- **Additional Requirements**:  
  - Clearly visible drone number or identifier  
  - Pilot name and contact information on or inside drone  
  - Transport Canada registration number if required by current regulations  

### Equipment Inspection Procedures

#### Pre-Event Inspection

- **Initial Check-in**:  
  - All drones must be presented for inspection before first use in a league event  
  - Documentation of drone specifications for league records  
  - Verification of compliance with class-specific requirements  
  - Weight check using calibrated scale  

- **Inspection Points**:  
  - Structural integrity check  
  - Failsafe function test (Sub-250 class only)  
  - Arming mechanism verification  
  - Propeller and motor condition assessment  
  - Battery condition verification  
  - VTX power and frequency check  

- **Approval Process**:  
  - Inspection checklist completion  
  - Safety approval sticker or marking  
  - Documentation of any conditional approvals or required modifications  

#### Random Spot Checks

- **When Conducted**:  
  - Randomly throughout event days  
  - After crashes or incidents  
  - When equipment modifications are made  

- **Focus Areas**:  
  - Weight compliance  
  - Post-crash structural integrity  
  - VTX power settings  
  - Battery condition  

- **Non-Compliance Procedure**:  
  - Drones failing inspection must be repaired before further competition  
  - Documentation of failed inspections  
  - Re-inspection after repairs completed  

### Special Considerations for Northern Operations

#### Cold Weather Equipment Requirements

- **Battery Handling**:  
  - Insulation requirements for outdoor operation in cold conditions  
  - Temperature monitoring during charging in cold environments  
  - Storage guidelines for batteries between flights in cold conditions  

- **Material Considerations**:  
  - Awareness of increased brittleness of some plastics in extreme cold  
  - Recommendations for cold-tolerant materials  
  - Additional structural inspection after flying in cold conditions  

#### Indoor Environment Adaptations

- **Limited Space Considerations**:  
  - Equipment appropriate for confined indoor spaces  
  - Reduced power settings for smaller venues  
  - Course design adaptations for available space  

### Equipment Modification and Repair

#### Permitted Modifications

- **During Events**:  
  - Propeller replacement with identical type  
  - Battery replacement with compliant alternative  
  - Minor repairs that don't affect safety features  
  - VTX frequency changes with coordination  

- **Requiring Re-inspection**:  
  - Frame repairs or replacements  
  - Motor changes  
  - Video system power modifications  
  - Any change affecting weight or center of gravity  

#### Prohibited Modifications

- **Safety Compromising Changes**:  
  - Removal of any required safety feature  
  - Exceeding weight limits  
  - Exceeding VTX power limits  
  - Disabling failsafe features  
  - Using damaged batteries  

### Equipment Documentation

- **Pilot Equipment Log**:  
  - Recommended tracking of drone specifications  
  - Maintenance history  
  - Crash incidents  
  - Battery cycle tracking  

- **League Equipment Records**:  
  - Database of inspected drones  
  - Inspection history  
  - Incident reports involving equipment failures  
  - Tracking of common equipment issues  

### Enforcement and Compliance

- **Responsibility Hierarchy**:  
  - Primary: Individual pilots responsible for their equipment  
  - Secondary: Race Technical Inspector  
  - Final: Racemaster has ultimate authority  

- **Non-compliance Consequences**:  
  - Minor issues: Warning and required correction  
  - Significant issues: Removal from current race  
  - Repeated issues: Potential suspension from league events  
  - Intentional violations: Review by executive committee  

This comprehensive approach to equipment safety establishes clear standards while acknowledging the practical realities of drone racing in northern communities. These requirements balance safety priorities with the need for accessible participation and reflect the unique considerations of operating in Fort Smithâ€™s environment.
