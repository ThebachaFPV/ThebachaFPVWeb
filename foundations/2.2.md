### Northern Context Considerations

The fulfillment of these roles must account for several northern realities:

- **Smaller Volunteer Pool**: Individuals may need to fulfill multiple roles or rotate responsibilities  
- **Geographic Challenges**: Some duties may need to be performed remotely or through digital means  
- **Weather Considerations**: Outdoor event roles require flexibility and alternative planning  
- **Resource Limitations**: Creative approaches may be needed to accomplish tasks with limited resources  
- **Seasonal Variations**: Role intensity may vary significantly between summer and winter operations  

This roles and responsibilities framework provides clarity while maintaining the flexibility needed for a developing league in a northern community. As the league grows, these definitions will evolve to meet changing needs and opportunities.
