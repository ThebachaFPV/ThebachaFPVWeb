With multiple UART port options, it supports various function expansions. This all-in-one solution seamlessly integrates FC, ESC, OSD, and VTX, and even offers an optional ELRS receiver. The micro-sized OSD chip is customized. Immerse yourself effortlessly in the racing and freestyle world with fingertip control, experiencing the unparalleled precision and responsiveness of the Air65.

UPGRADED AIR CANOPY

Experience high-quality, clear, and sharper images with the lightweight C03 FPV Micro Camera, weighing just 1.45g. We've redesigned the Air Canopy structure to be more flexible, impact-resistant, and durable. The improved bending effect enhances flexibility, reduces the chances of breakage, and greatly enhances explosion resistance, making installation easier. It effortlessly accommodates an assortment of Micro and Nano Analog cameras, supporting angle adjustment from 25° to 50°. With it, the Air65 can chase the limits of freestyle and racing victories with less worry.

PROPULSION SYSTEM

Whether it's the Freestyle or Racing Version, the Air65 remains agile enough to effortlessly conquer racing tracks, catering to the diverse needs of pilots. The Racing Version focuses on high-speed, high-agility flight, utilizing 0702SE|27000KV Motors and GF 1219S 3B Props for incredible speed bursts and agile steering. For a smooth and elegant free-flight experience, the Freestyle Version features 0702SE|23000KV Motors and HQ 31mm Ultralight 3B Props, allowing for timely responses and precise follow-up actions. This winning combo propels the Air65 far beyond any limitations in terms of speed and maneuverability.

AIR65 FRAME

To enhance the flying experience, DIY enthusiasts have diligently worked on reducing the weight of 65mm whoop drones, especially frames, for an ultra-light structure. We upgraded the Meteor65 Micro Frame to the Air65 Frame, achieving a remarkable weight reduction from 3.64g to 2.67g. This upgrade maintains exceptional strength and durability while introducing a new motor fixed slot and optimizing a low-profile design. With 6 color choices available, it indisputably emerges as the top choice for pilots seeking an unparalleled ultra-light Sub18g 65mm 1S whoop drone with personality.
