Z-FOLDING PROCESS
The Z-Folding Process Battery demonstrates remarkable performance and versatile capabilities. Leveraging its low internal resistance, it enables efficient high-current discharge within shorter time frames, resulting in elevated discharge platforms. Compared to the Winding Process Battery, it achieves a 0.2V higher discharge platform under equivalent loads, ensuring consistent and robust power output, additionally, it boasts a 5% higher energy density within the same volume, accompanied by an extended cycle life. The Z-Folding Process allows precise customization of electrode sizes based on lithium battery dimensions, optimizing control over battery size and shape. Its battery performance is superior, with a wider range of options for appearance and shape, and its applicability is also broader compared to the Winding Process Battery.



WARNING
Please fully charge the new battery before use.
Only use a charger designed for lithium polymer/Li-ion battery, and never leave the battery unattended during the charging process.
Always keep the battery away from flammable and explosive materials while charging.
Never overcharge the battery. The maximum voltage for a LiPo battery is 4.2V per cell, and for a LiHV battery is 4.35V per cell.
Never discharge the battery to a level below 3V per cell under load.
Do not store fully charged batteries for more than 3 days. For long-term storage, maintain the voltage between 3.8V and 3.9V.
Do not disassemble, crush, short circuit, or expose to flame or other sources of ignition.
Do not use batteries that are deformed or swollen.
