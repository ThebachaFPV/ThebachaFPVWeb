The first 1S FC to use the G473 processor, the Air Brushless Flight Controller (4IN1), offers balanced performance and lightness at only 2.9g. Powered by the industry-leading ICM42688P gyroscope, it delivers superior computing power and lightning-fast response times for precise flight execution compared to the F411. With multiple UART port options, it supports various function expansions. This all-in-one solution seamlessly integrates FC, ESC, OSD, and VTX, and even offers an optional ELRS receiver. The micro-sized OSD chip is customized. Immerse yourself effortlessly in the racing and freestyle world of fingertip control, where the unparalleled precision and responsiveness of the Air75 await.

UPGRADED AIR CANOPY

Experience high-quality, clear, and sharper images with the lightweight C03 FPV Micro Camera, weighing just 1.45g. We've redesigned the Air Canopy structure to be more flexible, impact-resistant, and durable. The improved bending effect enhances flexibility, reduces the chances of breakage, and greatly enhances explosion resistance, making installation easier. It effortlessly accommodates an assortment of Micro and Nano Analog cameras, supporting angle adjustment from 25° to 50°. With it, the Air75 can push the limits of racing victory with less worry.

PROPULSION SYSTEM

For a smooth and elegant free-flight experience, the Air75 features the Gemfan 40mm 2-Blade Props, with a larger pitch tip for quick response and crisp action. It is paired with the 0802SE | 23000KV Motor, allowing for timely responses and precise follow-up actions, enabling incredible speed bursts and agile steering. Equipped with the ultralight LAVA 1S 450mAh 75C Battery, which features the groundbreaking Z-Folding Process, the Air75 achieves a more concentrated center of gravity, crisper response, greater acceleration, and enhanced maneuverability.

AIR75 FRAME

To enhance the flying experience, DIY enthusiasts have diligently worked on reducing the weight of 75mm whoop drones, especially frames, for an ultra-light structure. We upgraded the Meteor75 Micro Frame to the Air75 Frame, achieving a remarkable weight reduction from 5.68g to 4.45g. This upgrade maintains exceptional strength and durability while introducing a new motor fixed slot and optimizing a low-profile design. With 8 color choices available, it indisputably emerges as the top choice for pilots seeking an unparalleled ultra-light Sub20g 75mm 1S whoop drone with personality.
